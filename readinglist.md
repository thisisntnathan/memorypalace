&ensp;The paper investigates the reasoning abilities of the LlaMa3-405B language model in non-English quiz contexts, specifically using questions from the Russian-speaking "What?Where?When?" community. It finds that while the model performs well linguistically, its cultural knowledge is lacking, leading to decreased performance. The study also highlights the significance of reasoning strategies, achieving a 6% accuracy improvement over baseline methods.

&ensp;The paper presents PathInHydro, a machine learning framework for identifying unbinding pathways of gas molecules from [NiFe] hydrogenases using molecular dynamics simulations. Trained on CO and H2 unbinding trajectories from Desulfovibrio fructosovorans, it efficiently analyzes diverse gas molecules and enzyme mutations. The framework enhances data analysis by automating pathway identification, with associated codes and datasets available online.

&ensp;The paper presents AlchemBERT, a lightweight BERT model (110 million parameters) for materials informatics, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting material properties using the Matbench dataset. AlchemBERT achieves performance comparable to larger models like GPT and LLaMA, excelling in structure prediction with CIF data. It outperforms state-of-the-art models, indicating fine-tuned LLMs can capture significant material insights.
