  &ensp;The paper develops a machine learning workflow to identify effective organic co-solvents for increasing the solubility of hydrophobic molecules in water. Using the AqSolDB and BigSolDB datasets, it employs a Light Gradient Boosting Machine model, achieving R2 scores of 0.864 for aqueous and 0.805 for organic solubility. The model's predictions are validated experimentally with benzaldehyde and limonene.
