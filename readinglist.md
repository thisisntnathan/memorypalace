&ensp;The paper presents a machine learning model for predicting retention time (RT) in LC-MS data analysis using a GATv2Conv+DL graph neural network. Trained on internal data and evaluated with the METLIN SMRT dataset, the model achieved a mean absolute error of 2.83 seconds. It was integrated into an existing LC-MS tool, with 95% of data within the RT range of -11.34 to +10.68 seconds.

2025-03-10  
&ensp;The paper explores how cavity quantum electrodynamics can alter selectivity in a Diels-Alder reaction, using a parameterized quantum electrodynamic (pQED) approach. It shows that coupling to the cavity changes selectivity from equal probabilities of Endo/Exo isomers outside the cavity. The findings align with high-level QED methods, demonstrating electron density redistribution due to the cavity effects.

2025-03-10  
&ensp;The paper discusses reproducibility in machine-learned collective variable (MLCV) spaces for calculating free energy surfaces (FES). It identifies the influence of training variability and hyperparameter roughness on reproducibility, proposing a Geometric Free Energy representation and a normalization factor to unify definitions and improve gradient modeling. These approaches aim to enhance the adoption of MLCVs in molecular simulations.

2025-03-06  
&ensp;The paper evaluates twelve machine learning models, including random forests and graph neural networks, on eight datasets to assess their robustness on out-of-distribution (OOD) data. It reveals that OOD data, particularly chemical similarity clustering, poses challenges for model performance. The correlation between in-distribution (ID) and OOD performance varies significantly, informing model selection based on application domains.

&ensp;This study evaluates twelve machine learning models for molecular property prediction, focusing on their performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) data using eight datasets and seven splitting strategies. It finds that while classical and GNN models perform similarly under scaffold-based splitting, cluster-based splitting presents more challenges. The correlation between in-distribution and OOD performance varies significantly, emphasizing careful model selection for specific applications.
