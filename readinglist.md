&ensp;The paper introduces RIGR, a Resonance Invariant Graph Representation that improves molecular property predictions by creating a single representation for resonance-exhibiting molecules. Evaluated on a large dataset using the D-MPNN architecture, RIGR outperforms Chemprop while using 60% fewer features. It is available as an open-source featurization scheme, showing promise in various property prediction tasks.

&ensp;This study evaluates twelve machine learning models for molecular property prediction, focusing on their performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) data using eight datasets and seven splitting strategies. It finds that while classical and GNN models perform similarly under scaffold-based splitting, cluster-based splitting presents more challenges. The correlation between in-distribution and OOD performance varies significantly, emphasizing careful model selection for specific applications.
