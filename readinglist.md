&ensp;The paper reviews human-induced pollution in rivers, focusing on India and China, with a dataset encompassing water quality tests from 603 rivers. It employs multivariate statistical methods to analyze seasonal variations, finding that 90% of water samples in Uttarakhand were contaminated. Key analyzed parameters included TDS, BOD, and E. coli. The study calls for coordinated global efforts to tackle the water crisis.  
- [Discovery of Clonixeril as a Sub-Femtomolar Modulator of the Human STING Receptor](https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-bxr73-v3?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss)

&ensp;The paper reports the discovery of clonixeril (CXL) as a potent modulator of the human STING receptor, with an EC50 ranging from 1 fM to above 1 nM based on in vitro and in cellulo studies. Molecular dynamics models and biophysical techniques were employed for characterization, revealing CXL's strong inhibitory effect on interferon production in THP-1 cells.

&ensp;The paper presents an integrated medicinal chemistry workflow that accelerates hit-to-lead optimization in drug discovery. Using high-throughput experimentation, a dataset of 13,490 reaction outcomes was generated, training deep graph neural networks. A virtual library of 26,375 molecules led to 212 candidate MAGL inhibitors, with 14 achieving subnanomolar activity, improving potency up to 4500 times over original compounds.  
- [Quaternary biopesticides and disinfectants derived from quinine and amino acids – environmental prospects and risks](https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-h5hbb-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss)

&ensp;The paper explores new, safer quaternary ammonium salts (QASs) synthesized from quinine and amino acids, specifically L-asparagine and L-alanine. Characterized for chemical structure and biological activity, these compounds show strong antifeedant effects and low phytotoxicity. Toxicity assessments on various organisms (Sorghum bicolor, Sinapis alba, Chlorella vulgaris, Daphnia magna) reveal promising environmental safety for these biopesticides.
